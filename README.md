# GutenbergAPITypeScript
This is the gutenbergAPI that I wrote for my final project, that can directly be integrated with React I hope it'd be helpful to anybody else. 

You can use it directly fetch book meta-data, search or download e-book content. 

Be wary that that Gutenburg's metadata for texts will have different formats, so make sure to cover all formats as keys.
